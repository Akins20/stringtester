# String Operations App

The **String Operations App** is a web-based application built with **Next.js** that allows users to perform various operations on strings. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input a string, select an operation, and view the result in real-time. The app supports a wide range of string operations, including reversing, converting case, counting characters, checking for palindromes, and more. Additionally, it includes advanced features like detecting and executing functions within the input string.

## Features

### 1. **String Operations**
   - **Reverse**: Reverses the input string.
   - **Uppercase**: Converts the input string to uppercase.
   - **Lowercase**: Converts the input string to lowercase.
   - **Count Characters**: Counts the number of characters in the input string.
   - **Split Characters**: Splits the input string into individual characters.
   - **Check Palindrome**: Checks if the input string is a palindrome.
   - **Check for Object**: Detects if the input string contains a valid JSON object.
   - **Check for Boolean**: Detects if the input string contains a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
   - **Check for Array**: Detects if the input string contains a valid JSON array.
   - **Check for Number**: Detects if the input string contains numeric values.
   - **Check for Special Characters**: Detects if the input string contains special characters.
   - **Check for Function**: Detects if the input string contains a function, identifies its location, and executes it (with `var` and `let` forced into `const` for safer execution).

### 2. **Responsive Design**
   - The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both **mobile** and **desktop** screens.
   - On mobile devices, the layout stacks the input and result sections vertically.
   - On desktop devices, the layout displays the input and result sections side by side.

### 3. **Custom CSS Styling**
   - The app uses custom CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and modern design.
   - Features like hover effects, transitions, and gradients enhance the user experience.

### 4. **Dynamic Result Display**
   - The result of the selected operation is displayed in real-time.
   - The result section is scrollable, making it easy to view long outputs.
